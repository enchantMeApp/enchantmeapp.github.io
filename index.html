<h1>Privacy Policy – Enchant Me!</h1>

<p><strong>Last updated:</strong> 22.12.2025</p>

<p>
Enchant Me! respects your privacy. This application is designed to function without collecting,
storing, or processing personal user data. The app does not require registration, accounts,
or login of any kind.
</p>

<h2>1. Data Collection</h2>

<p>
Enchant Me! does not collect personal information such as names, email addresses, phone numbers,
precise location data, contacts, messages, or any other personal identifiers. All functionality
is available without providing personal data.
</p>

<h2>2. App Functionality and Internet Usage</h2>

<p>
Enchant Me! requires an active internet connection to operate. The app retrieves prewritten,
non-personal content from publicly available text files hosted on GitHub. This includes tarot
reading templates, horoscope content, and moon phase information.
</p>

<p>
This content is downloaded when the app starts and stored temporarily in the app’s memory for use
during the current session. No personal information is transmitted during this process, and no
data is uploaded from the user’s device.
</p>

<h2>3. Advertising</h2>

<p>
Enchant Me! uses Google AdMob to display advertisements. AdMob may automatically collect limited
device information such as advertising identifiers, device type, and basic app interaction data.
This information is used by Google to deliver personalized or non-personalized advertisements,
depending on the user’s device and system settings.
</p>

<p>
Google’s use of data is governed by its own privacy policy, which can be found at:
<a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
https://policies.google.com/privacy
</a>
</p>

<h2>4. User-Stored Data</h2>

<p>
Enchant Me! allows users to save tarot readings, sigils, spell notes, and related app data locally
on their device. The app also allows users to export this data to a local file and import it on
another device for migration purposes.
</p>

<p>
All saved data remains entirely on the user’s device. This data is never uploaded to external
servers and is not accessible to the developer. The app accesses this data only to display it
locally to the user.
</p>

<h2>5. Third-Party Services</h2>

<p>
Enchant Me! uses third-party services strictly for functionality and monetization purposes.
These services include Google AdMob for advertising and GitHub for hosting static content files.
No personal user data is shared with GitHub. Content is retrieved as static text files only.
</p>

<h2>6. Children’s Privacy</h2>

<p>
Enchant Me! is not directed toward children under the age of 13. The app does not knowingly collect
personal information from children. If you believe that a child has provided personal data, please
contact the developer so appropriate action can be taken.
</p>

<h2>7. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>

<p>
This privacy policy may be updated from time to time. Any changes will be posted on this page and
will take effect immediately upon publication.
</p>

<h2>8. Contact</h2>
